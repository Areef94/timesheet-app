Purpose:
The purpose of the project is to take record of people working in a company to make sure who comes in, goes out, goes for a lunch break. The target audience is HR departments of the companies.
App takes employee name and asks him/her what they are going to do. Then date button automatically implements the date in the table to show the records.

Design and Implementation Constraints:
Initialy, it was planned to make it in React using context API but it became more complicated. For that reason, simple JavaScript and HTML along with bootstrap were choosen.

● Please describe your process for approaching the code challenge. What kind of
planning did you do? Did your plans change as you began coding?
I made a prototpye of the project using Bubble.io. Read the pdf file and wrote the points which would be used in the project on the paper. Sincerely, plans were changed as there were a lot of things which I was not able to add in the project. Initialy, project would have been done in React.js but it became more complex to complete.


● Describe the schema design you chose. Why did you choose this design? What
other alternatives did you consider?
The design is simple and somehow fullfils the requirements. The ideal application in my mind was Top Tracker. As it has some timer in it. But it was indeed not in my knowledge that how can I make a timer like that for timesheet. 

● If you were given another day to work on this, how would you spend it? What if
you were given a month?
The problem I have been facing is the deployment on surge.sh. Heroku was new for me and it failed to deploy the project. Surge doployed it but it only interprets the HTML file while JavaScript functionalities cannot be seen or used. Github workflow failed a lot to deploy it. This is the only issue I need to resolve.
